1]Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
The "products" table and "categories" table have a one-to-many relationship. This is because, for each category, there can be multiple products (many products in one category), but each product can only belong to one category.


2] How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
So we can category ID for product to ensure each product has a valid catergory.
